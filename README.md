# Scenario

Using a platform called VirusTotal which allows you to scan different security indicators to see whether or not they have been flagged as malicious. Your task as part of this is to write a Python script that interacts with VirusTotal to bring back information on the below indicators as well as fulfil the required success criteria

Indicators:

* google.com
* myetherevvalliet.com

## Success Criteria

* Must make a request to VirusTotal for both the indicators specified above
* For each indicator, we want a message that indicates whether or not that indicator is safe or not. Make it an obvious print message when the indicator is marked as malicious

## Pre-reqs

* You must sign up for an account at VirusTotal. You can sign up [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us), it's **free**.
* Read the documentation to familiarise yourself with the API and its purpose. You can view the documentation [here](https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002739245-Searching)
